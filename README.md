# "I Don't Fucking Care Public License"
If i'm too lazy to set a license to `GNU GPL v3` i am using this piece of crap.

## Do whatever you want, even post it on r34 (sexy code meow lolz)
I don't care about that, it isn't a work of art, it is just a piece of runnable crap that i wrote while drunk at 2am with my drunk (too) friends.
If you want to steal it for your purposes, do it. Maybe i'll see it and give you the "3/10 not terrible" award.

## If something doesn't work, post it in issues and nothing else.
I don't give a fuck about errors in my code, if you saw one, just report it in issues tab. MAYBE i will fix it (if i can)

## If you want to sell a product as a company. Stop using my code
If you really want to use it, make it free software (plez).

## "Github, don't deepfake my code!"
I strictly prohibiting using code with - for example - github copilot. It destroys jobs, steals code and does many other unethical things.

## Dont sell the software under this license

Selling copies of a program is crime. i hate it. and then every soyslave pirates your stuff.
And i think i would pirate it too. and decompile it. and release the source code online.

# "IDFCPL: Music Edition"
I license my music with it.

## "can i uze dis in dat?"
Basically you can, i just do stuff for the sake of it. It makes me happy to see my shit on the internet.

## plez credit
i'd like some recognition. no pressure but it would be nice to credit me.

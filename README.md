# "I Don't Fucking Care Public License"
If i'm too lazy to set a license to `GNU GPL v3` i am using this piece of crap.

## Do whatever you want, even post it on r34 (sexy code meow lolz)
I don't care about that, it isn't a work of art, it is just a piece of runnable crap that i wrote while drunk at 2am with my drunk (too) friends.
If you want to steal it for your purposes, do it. Maybe i will see it and give you a "Code lvl non-YandereDev" award.

## If something doesn't work, post it in issues and nothing else.
I don't give a fuck about errors in my code, if you saw one, just report it in issues tab. MAYBE i will fix it (if i can)

# "I Don't Fucking Care Public License"
If i'm too lazy to set a license to `GNU GPL v3` i am using this piece of crap.

## Do whatever you want, even post it on r34 (sexy code meow lolz)
I don't care about that, it isn't a work of art, it is just a piece of runnable crap that i wrote while drunk at 2am with my drunk (too) friends.
If you want to steal it for your purposes, do it. Maybe i will see it and give you a "Code lvl non-YandereDev" award.

## If something doesn't work, post it in issues and nothing else.
I don't give a fuck about errors in my code, if you saw one, just report it in issues tab. MAYBE i will fix it (if i can)

## If you are a big corporation. Stop using my code:

- Microsoft
- Google
- Apple
- Amazon
- Netflix
- Spotify
- Windows Users
- Huawei
- Xiaomi
- Sony
- Facebook
- many others

If you really want to use it, make it free software.

## Dont sell the software under this license

Selling copies of a program is crime. i hate it. and then every soyslave pirates your stuff.
And i think i would pirate it too. and decompile it. and release the source code online.
